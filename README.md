# NodeMcu(ESP8266)

 *NodeMcu kit projects and examples using C/C++*



NodeMcu is a dev-kit based on esp family you can program it using lua , C/C++ , Arduino C , python and more.
but here we will use C/C++ and Arduino C 

NOTE: Whatever that can works on NodeMCU can works on any ESP8266 kit 

you can know more about Arduino IDE library from here 
https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino

In the slides here you will find how to setup ESP8266 on Arduino IDE and introduction about NodeMcu , ESP8266 H.W modules and micro-documinitation for th basic functions in the Arduino library API
